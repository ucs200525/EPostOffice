E-Post Office Data Organization
==============================

Current Structure Issues:
------------------------
1. Redundant concepts: Orders, Shipments, and Packages are overlapping
2. Multiple routes handling similar functionality
3. Confusing data flow

Recommended Structure:
--------------------
Everything should be consolidated under "Orders" because:

1. Orders (Primary Concept)
   - Represents the complete shipping transaction
   - Contains:
     * Tracking number
     * Shipping details (addresses, package info)
     * Cost information
     * Payment status
     * Timeline/tracking history
     * Customer information

2. Remove /shipments because:
   - It's redundant with orders
   - Creates confusion in tracking
   - Same data being stored in multiple places
   - Harder to maintain consistency

3. Remove /packages because:
   - Package details should be part of the order
   - No need for separate tracking
   - Simplifies the data model

Correct Data Flow:
----------------
1. Customer creates order
   /api/orders/create
   → Creates single order record with all necessary info

2. Track shipment
   /api/orders/track/:trackingNumber
   → Uses the order record for tracking

3. View order history
   /api/orders/my-orders
   → Lists all orders for a customer

Database Structure:
-----------------
Single Order Model containing:
{
  trackingNumber: String,
  userId: ObjectId,
  type: 'domestic' | 'international',
  status: String,
  shippingDetails: {
    senderAddress: String,
    receiverAddress: String,
    packageInfo: {
      weight: Number,
      dimensions: Object,
      type: String
    }
  },
  timeline: [{
    status: String,
    location: String,
    timestamp: Date
  }],
  cost: {
    baseRate: Number,
    serviceFee: Number,
    total: Number
  },
  transactionId: ObjectId
}

Action Items:
-----------
1. Remove /shipments routes
2. Remove /packages routes
3. Consolidate all shipping functionality under /orders
4. Update frontend to use only /orders endpoints
5. Migrate existing data to unified structure
